		<h2> Volcanoes </h2>
		
		<p><u> Hawai&apos;i is commonly known for its volcanoes.</u> Volcanoes in Hawaii have been around for millions of years. The main volcanoes in Hawaii are called “shield” volcanoes. These volcanoes produce lava flows that form shields like mountains. Shield volcanoes are more on the wider side than they are tall.</p>
		
		<h3> Mauna Loa</h3>

Its last eruption was 1984, which killed thousands of people and triggered tsunamis. It is a very deadly volcano that, when it erupts, it can cause famines from its thick ash deposits.
